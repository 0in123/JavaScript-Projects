var Sent1 = "This is the beginning of the string"; // I am assigning a string to variable Sent1
var Sent2 = " and this is the end of the string"; // I am assigning a string to variable Sent2

window.alert("Hello! Did you know that 5+3 = " + (5 + 3) + "?"); // I am showing a pop up alert with the value of 5+3 and a string concatenated to it to show the answer
